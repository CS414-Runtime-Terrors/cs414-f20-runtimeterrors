# Goals For The Meeting
- Finish getting the tasks on the Planning Board.
- Talk about GitHub procedures.

# GitHub Procedures
- Only move a task into ‘In Progress’ and assign it to yourself when you’re working on it.
- Label tasks as ‘Help Wanted’ if you’re struggling with something, that way team members will know who needs help and with what.
- Try to work on the same epic if there are enough tasks.
- Have a maximum of 5 epics in progress at once AKA don’t leave things unfinished.
- Always rebase your code or merge master into your branch before creating a pull request.
- When reviewing a pull request, review each file that was changed using the system GitHub provides.
