# Meeting Notes (10/7/20)
- We decided that to implement the wizard spots into the board, the 2D board array will be 11x11 rather than 10x10. The wizards will be placed in the corners upon initialization and the extra (out of bounds) spots will be populated with a new "not valid" piece that cannot move and will make sure that no other pieces will be moved there.
