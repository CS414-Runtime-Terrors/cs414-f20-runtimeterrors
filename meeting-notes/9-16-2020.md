# Goals For The Meeting
- Assign an agreed upon story point for every task that has been created.
- Decide what graphical library we will use.

# Graphical Library Choice
- Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL) https://www.lwjgl.org/

# GitHub Procedures
- Only move a task into ‘In Progress’ and assign it to yourself when you’re working on it.
- Label tasks as ‘Help Wanted’ if you’re struggling with something, that way team members will know who needs help and with what.
- Try to work on the same epic if there are enough tasks.
- Have a maximum of 5 epics in progress at once AKA don’t leave things unfinished.
- Always rebase your code or merge master into your branch before creating a pull request.
- When reviewing a pull request, review each file that was changed using the system GitHub provides.
- A story point will be analogous to an hour of work.
- Every task encompasses implementation and testing.

# Next Time
Make sure everyone is on the same page with how every epic will be implemented by providing epic and task descriptions.
