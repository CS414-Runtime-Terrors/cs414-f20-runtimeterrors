Omega Chess is a fun variant of the classic board game.
The game is played on an expanded 10x10 board with an additional
diagonally adjacent square to each corner and has two new pieces:
the Champion and the Wizard

The rules and board layout of Omega Chess are the same as standard
chess with the following additions:

1. The Champions start at the corners of the 10x10 board next to
     the Rooks

2. The Wizards start at the additional squares diagonally adjacent
     to the Champion

3. The Pawns can move up to three squares forward on the first move

4. The Champion can leap two squares in any direction or slide one
     square orthogonally

5. The Wizard, like Bishops, is color-bound and can slide one square
     diagonally or leap in a three-by-one "L" pattern similar to a Knight
